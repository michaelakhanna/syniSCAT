"""
Offline helper for automated calculation of `pupil_samples` (CDD Section 6.1).

This module implements a one-time, high-resolution procedure to determine the
minimum required grid size for the pupil function (`pupil_samples`) that
ensures the resulting PSF is not effectively truncated due to finite grid
support.

Design & Usage
--------------
- This computation is **not** part of the main simulation pipeline. It is
  intended to be run manually (or as part of an offline calibration script)
  once for each optical preset (combination of NA, wavelength, medium index,
  apodization, etc.).
- The resulting integer `pupil_samples` is then written into the preset
  definition (e.g., in `config.PARAMS` or an instrument preset), and the main
  simulation uses that fixed value.

Algorithm (aligned with CDD Section 6.1)
----------------------------------------
Inputs:
    - numerical_aperture (NA)
    - wavelength_nm
    - refractive_index_medium
    - apodization_factor
    - amplitude_threshold (relative to peak amplitude, e.g., 1e-6)
    - ground_truth_samples (e.g., 65,536)

Steps:
    1. Construct a high-resolution 1D pupil function P(u) representing a
       circular aperture with apodization:
           - u is a dimensionless radial coordinate in the pupil plane.
           - |u| <= 1 corresponds to the open aperture; outside this region,
             P(u) = 0.
           - Inside the aperture, the amplitude is modulated by a simple
             Gaussian-like apodization exp(-apodization_factor * rho^2),
             where rho = |u|.

    2. Compute the 1D complex Amplitude Spread Function (ASF) via a large 1D
       FFT:
           ASF(x) = FFT{P(u)} (up to constant factors).
       This 1D ASF is a radial cross-section of the full 2D PSF for a
       radially symmetric pupil.

    3. Normalize the ASF amplitude so that its peak magnitude is 1.0:
           A(x) = |ASF(x)| / max_x |ASF(x)|

    4. Scan radially outward from the central peak and record the smallest
       radius (in samples) at which A(x) first falls below the chosen
       amplitude_threshold. This radius is r_cutoff.

    5. The minimum required PSF diameter in samples is:
           D_required = 2 * r_cutoff

    6. For FFT efficiency in the main simulation, choose the smallest power of
       two greater than or equal to D_required:
           pupil_samples = 2**ceil(log2(D_required))

This procedure works entirely in dimensionless units; NA, wavelength, and
refractive index are used here for validation and future refinements, but the
shape of the ASF in normalized coordinates is governed by the aperture and
apodization.

Note:
    - This implementation deliberately avoids any dependency on the rest of the
      simulation pipeline. It is safe to run standalone and does not modify
      global state or PARAMS.

    Compute a recommended value for `pupil_samples` using a high-resolution
    1D ASF calculation.

    This function is designed for offline use. It accepts the key optical
    parameters, constructs a dimensionless 1D pupil function with apodization,
    computes a high-resolution ASF via FFT, and then determines the minimum
    required pupil grid size so that the ASF is negligible (below
    amplitude_threshold) at the grid edge.

    Args:
        numerical_aperture (float):
            Objective numerical aperture (NA). Must satisfy
                0 < NA <= refractive_index_medium.
            Used here for basic validation; the ASF calculation is performed
            in normalized coordinates and does not depend on the absolute
            scaling of NA.

        wavelength_nm (float):
            Illumination wavelength in vacuum in nanometers. Must be positive.
            Currently used only for validation and documentation; the 1D ASF
            calculation is performed in normalized coordinates.

        refractive_index_medium (float):
            Refractive index of the sample medium. Must be positive. NA is
            checked against this value.

        apodization_factor (float):
            Dimensionless factor controlling the strength of Gaussian-like
            apodization in the pupil amplitude. Larger values increase the
            attenuation near the pupil edge. This is the same parameter used
            in the main simulation's pupil function.

        amplitude_threshold (float, optional):
            Relative amplitude threshold in (0, 1). The ASF amplitude is
            normalized so that its peak value is 1.0; the algorithm identifies
            the first radius where the amplitude falls below this value and
            uses that as the cutoff. A typical value is 1e-6.

        ground_truth_samples (int, optional):
            Number of samples in the high-resolution 1D pupil and ASF used to
            approximate the "ground truth" PSF. Must be a reasonably large
            positive integer. A typical value is 65,536 (2**16). The actual
            FFT length used is rounded up to the next power of two.

    Returns:
        int:
            Recommended `pupil_samples` value, guaranteed to be a power of two
            and at least 4. This value can be used directly in the main
            simulation for the given optical configuration.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If any of the input parameters are invalid (e.g., non-positive NA,
            wavelength, or medium index; amplitude_threshold not in (0, 1);
            ground_truth_samples too small).
